## Preparation 
 - Download X86 and LLVM Semantics. 
  ```
  mkdir Github // The reason for enforcing this directory is that the scripts are
               // hardcoded to pick from $home/Github/...
               // If you decide to put things in different place, you may need to
               // fix paths in the following scripts
               //
               // binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/process_spec.pl
               // binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/update_instructions_sematics.pl
               // binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/run.pl
               // binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/remove_directives.pl
  
  cd !$
  // Clone the following
  // 2 and 3 are requred incase we need to gather statistics.
  1. git clone https://github.com/sdasgup3/binary-decompilation.git [merge]
  2. git clone https://github.com/sdasgup3/x86-64-instruction-summary.git    
  3. git clone --recursive  https://github.com/sdasgup3/strata-data-private.git  strata-data
  4.  git clone https://github.com/sdasgup3/llvm-verified-backend.git [f_llvm_parser] (preferred) OR
      git clone https://github.com/theo25/llvm-verified-backend.git [f_llvm_parser]  
     // In case the llvm-verified-backend is cloned in places other than
     // Github, then fix the paths in binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/process_spec.pl to 
     // include the correct module paths (search for compile and and update the include paths).
  ```

 - Download the K tool
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sdasgup3/k5.git [working branch]

  ```

## To compile the x86-64 semantics
  - The following commands will compile the semantics WITHOUT any rules for
  instructions (as the 'underTestInstructions' is empty).  The reason is if we
  include all the instruction's rules, then the kompile/krun/kprove all will be
  super slow. Hence, depending on which instructions sequences we are working
  on, we include their rules in the 'underTestInstructions' directory and
  compile them.  
  
  ``` 
  cd binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/semantics 
  mkdir -p underTestInstructions/ 
  ../scripts/process_spec.pl --compile 
  ```

## Running X86 programs with the semantics

### Running single program: bubblesort 
```
cd  binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/tests/Programs/bubblesort/

// Populate the 'underTestInstructions' directory with relevant
// rules corresponding to instructions in bubblesort program.
../../../scripts/collect_instructions_semantics.pl --file test.s

make cleankstate; make kstate  // Checks successful completion of krun and stores the final state in Output/test.kstate

If you want to generate a freash .s file:
gcc test.c -fno-diagnostics-show-caret -fdiagnostics-color=never    -O0  -w  -lm  -march=haswell -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -mlong-double-64 -mno-80387 -S -o test.asm
binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/scripts/remove_directives.pl --i --file test.s 
```


## Running kprove
 1. All the program verification example are there in program-veriifcation
   folder.
   ```
    cd binary-decompilation/x86-semantics/program-veriifcation
    gvim README.md // instructions for execution
   ```
